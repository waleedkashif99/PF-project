# PF-FinalProject
this is my repository of my 1st semester project

I have created a C program called "Alexander-The Answer machine." In this program, the user inputs a question, and the program provides an answer. For example, if I ask, "What is the color of my shirt?" it will tell me the color of my shirt.

This is actually a trick game, and only the person who knows the trick can operate it. The person who knows the trick is referred to as the boss in this program. If someone other than the boss tries to run the program, it responds with "I will answer my boss only."

The secret trick is that when you start typing something after a slash, the screen displays a predefined string. In this way, the boss uses a slash to indicate the answer to the upcoming question, and after completing the answer, another slash is added. Then the program takes a question from the boss and displays the same string that was fed between the two slashes as the answer. This way, someone watching might think it's a mind reader or an advanced chatbot providing such answers.
